# Standard-Algorithms

### 1) Bsearch and Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort - Recursive and Iterative - (Divide and Conquer)
- Quick Sort - Recursive and Iterative
- Bubble Sort - Recursive and Iterative
- Selection sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort - Recursive and Iterative

### 2) Vectors, Stack, Queues
- Basic Implementations of the Vectors, Stack 
- Stack nearest Smaller number - O(n) 
- Two Pointers - Sliding window and opposite pointers - O(n) 
- Maximum Area - Stack Implementation of nearest smaller number - O(n) 
- Maximum Area - Brute Force algo - O(n2)

### 3) CPP - STL:
- Maps	
- Sets	
- Priority Queues

### 4) Graphs Algorithms
- Searching Graphs 
- Shortest Path Problem
- Negative Cycle
- Stronly Connected components
- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Bridges
- Articulation points
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Maximum Flow Networks
